                                in-game market. Virtual islands are important elements of the gaming infrastructure.
                                Players can buy plots of land from MASD after adaptation or on the market. It is
                                important to note that there are few plots in the universe, and each plot of land is
                                represented as NFT tokens Avatars are used to represent players in the game. Players can
                                customize and personalize their avatars with combat gear and modify them by installing
                                various assets on them. Players can collect and sell various in-game items such as
                                houses, bunkers, weapons and equipment in the virtual in-game market. MASD GAMES will
                                have a reputation and rating system that rewards players with various items
                                opportunities to work on a common goal and pool resources to complete exciting tasks.
                                For example, the game will implement community-created events in which players will
                                participate in events and competitions. It will also include a decentralized forum where
                                users will be able to discuss game actions, find out the schedule of upcoming votes in a
                                decentralized organization, search for new friends, etc.
